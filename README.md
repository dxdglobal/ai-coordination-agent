Project Overview – AI Coordination Agent
1. Executive Summary
The AI Coordination Agent is a next-generation virtual project coordinator designed to operate alongside the existing CRM system. It integrates through REST APIs, maintains its own AI-powered memory database, and leverages OpenAI reasoning models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and multi-agent role systems (MetaGPT-style) to coordinate projects, tasks, users, clients, and communications.

Unlike traditional automation tools, this agent acts like a human project manager—tracking deadlines, adding reminders, escalating issues, generating reports, and ensuring compliance with organizational standards.

2. Objectives
Centralized Tracking → Projects, tasks, users, clients, notifications, comments, and chats.

AI Memory → Persistent knowledge of all task histories, comments, and escalations.

Proactive Monitoring → Detect delays, inactivity, and bottlenecks in real-time.

Human-Like Reasoning → Make context-aware decisions (when to remind, escalate, or wait).

Multi-Channel Notifications → In-app, email, and WhatsApp (via Zender).

Handbook Compliance → Enforce checklists, revision cycles, approval flows, and QC.

Conversational Interface → ChatGPT-style Q&A across all company data.

RAG Integration → Retrieval of relevant CRM data, past comments, and handbook rules for precise, non-hallucinated answers.

Multi-Agent Glue → Assign role-based AI agents (Account Manager, Coordinator, Designer, Developer, SEO Specialist, HR, etc.) for team-like operation.

Automated Reporting → Daily, weekly, and monthly summaries for managers and clients.

3. Key Features
a. Tracking & Monitoring
Continuous monitoring of task statuses (Not Started, In Progress, Awaiting Feedback, Completed, etc.).

Intelligent escalation if tasks remain stuck.

b. AI Memory & RAG
Stores all past comments, decisions, and escalations.

Uses RAG to search CRM data + handbook + logs before answering.

Provides transparent responses with references (no hallucinations).

c. Escalation & Notifications
Step 1: In-app alerts.

Step 2: Email notifications.

Step 3: WhatsApp escalation if unresolved.

WhatsApp Example:

Hamza has not started the project yet. Please tell me what should I do? 1 - Follow up 2 - You will contact
AI executes decision and logs in memory.

d. Conversational Assistant
Chat interface for queries:

“Show me all tasks awaiting approval.”

“What’s the revision policy?”

“What’s Hamza’s last active task?”

Context-aware, reasoning-driven responses.

e. Handbook Enforcement
Applies templates & checklists automatically (content, design, ads, SEO).

Enforces revision cycles (2–3 max).

Ensures dual-approval (Coordination + Account Mgmt).

Validates file/folder structures & version control.

f. Reporting
Daily: Tasks started, delayed, completed.

Weekly: Project progress %, overdue tasks, employee performance.

Monthly: Department summaries (Design, Dev, SEO, HR).

Reports accessible via dashboard + auto-delivered via Email/WhatsApp PDF.

g. Multi-Agent Role System (MetaGPT-Style)
Central AI Coordinator (main agent).

Role Agents:

Account Manager AI

AI Coordinator

AI Designer

AI Developer

SEO/Advertising AI

HR/Operations AI

Each agent handles role-specific queries and workflows, reporting back to the central AI.

4. Technology Stack

Frontend: React / Next.js (chat interface + dashboards).

Databases:

CRM DB (existing)

AI Memory DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL with pgvector for embeddings).

AI Engines:

OpenAI GPT (reasoning, conversation).

RAG (retrieval from CRM, handbook, memory DB).

Multi-Agent Framework (MetaGPT).

Integrations: REST APIs for CRM, Zender WhatsApp, Email, Notifications.

Hosting: AWS/Azure (scalable microservices).

5. Departmental Integration
Account Management: Automated client reporting, communication tracking.

Coordination: Design/feedback monitoring, meeting logs, escalation management.

Design: Checklist enforcement, revision cycles, file control.

Development: Tracks testing, bug-fixing, documentation cycles.

SEO & Advertising: Alerts on missing optimizations, campaign monitoring.

HR & Operations: Logs performance, recruitment, payroll deadlines.

Corporate Communications & Finance: Consistency in reporting and file structures.

6. Benefits & Value Proposition

Multi-language

Predictive AI for workload balancing and risk analysis.

8. Conclusion
The AI Coordination Agent is not just an add-on to CRM but a human-like digital project coordinator.
By combining:

CRM data integration,

AI memory with RAG for accuracy,

Escalation workflows (email + WhatsApp),

Handbook enforcement, and

Multi-agent collaboration (MetaGPT style)

…it transforms project management into a proactive, intelligent, and transparent system.

This ensures that no task is forgotten, every delay is addressed, every department is aligned, and every client receives accurate updates—instantly.
